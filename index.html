            <p>Photography has always been one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
            <p>I take pictures, it's like seeing things in a new perspective literally and figuratively. you can go
                up to a flower and see
                the texture of the petal or put a caterpillar on your finger and see the little hairlike things on
                it's body.</p>
            <p>Thing about the camera and the lens is that it lets you see people, places, etc. in a whole new
                perspective and it helps to see things from a different view. From photography, I realized that getting
                a different view of things means you have a more open mind to the world.</p>
            <p>Which is why it's always been my favorite hobby.</p>
